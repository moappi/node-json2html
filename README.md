Why json2html?
--------------
Instead of writing HTML templates json2html relies on JSON transforms to convert a source JSON objects to html.  The benefit of using a JSON transform is that they are already readable by the browser and DO NOT require any compilation before use.   In addition, json2html allows the following

+	Short hand notation for mapping data objects to markup
+	Event binding to DOM objects (exclusively with jquery.json2html) 
+	Use of inline functions to allow for complex logic during transformation 
+	Dynamic building of transform objects
